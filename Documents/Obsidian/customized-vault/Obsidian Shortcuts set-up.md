### Info: 
Hello! Welcome to my Obsidian set-up. This is for my personal use, so may be some stuff may not make sense to you, feel free to change it as you like and enjoy it as much as I do. 

My aim here was to create a very minimal looking Obsidian. Below I am sharing some of the useful shortcuts. 

You will see there the ~~underline~~ and ==strike through== are formatted differently because I don't really use strike through, so I am using this as an other colour option and also while I was at it, I have also changed the colour of underline text as well to make it more pleasing to my eyes. 

If you already have a big vault where you want to use or try this configuration, it is enough that you **copy and paste** the **.obsidian** folder that is inside this vault, inside your vault. ðŸ™ƒ
